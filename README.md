# ACO-Cellnopt

CellNOpt is a framework to build predictive
logic-based models of signaling pathways by training a prior knowledge
network to biochemical data obtained from perturbation experiments. This
training can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved using
metaheuristics. this code proposes a training method based on ant colony optimization,
adapted to the cellnopt framework and parallelized using a hybrid approach MPI+OPM.
